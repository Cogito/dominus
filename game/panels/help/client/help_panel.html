						<p>{{game_name}} is a slow strategy game that does not require a lot of time to play.  Give your armies their orders then come back in a few hours to check on them.</p>

						<p>Everyone has one castle.  Your castle is where you hire soldiers.</p>

						<div class="help_section">Build an Army</div>
						<p>The first thing you should do is to build an army.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Click on your castle.  It's the one with the green flag.</li>
							<li>Click the "Hire Soldiers" button.</li>
							<li>Move the footmen slider to the right.</li>
							<li>Click the "Hire" button.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You will now have footmen inside your castle.</p>

						<div class="help_section">Build a Village</div>
						<p>Villages increase your resources.  Each village you have collects {{s.resource.gained_at_hex}} resources from the ring of hexes surrounding it.  Use an army to build a village.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Find a good hex to build your village at.  You can only build villages on grain hexes, those are the light green ones.  Find a grain hex near your castle that is surrounded by hexes other than grain.</li>
							<li>Click on your castle.</li>
							<li>Click the "Send Army from Castle" button.</li>
							<li>Move the footmen slider to the right.</li>
							<li>Click on the hex where you want to build your village.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You should now see your army next to your castle.  If you click on your army you will see their path highlighted and how long it will take to reach their destination.  When they reach their destination they will have a "Build Village" button which you can click on to build your village.</p>
						<p>When you have enough resources then you should hire soldiers to protect your castle and villages.</p>
						<p>After you have an army try attacking someone's castle to gain a vassal.</p>
