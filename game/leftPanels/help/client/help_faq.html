                You're already contributing by playing but here are a few other ways you can help.

                <b>Spread the Word</b><br>
                It's very hard to find new players without paying for ads.  There's a graph in the graph panel showing number of people playing.  Help make it grow. Please tweet, like, star, review Dominus and tell your friends.
            </p>

            <div class="help_section">Strategy</div>
            <ul>
                <li>It's not always a bad thing if someone takes your castle.  Having a lord gives you protection, an ally and they can send you soldiers/gold.</li>
                <li>Always combine your armies when in battle.  Each army in a battle takes losses.  Having two armies in a battle will cause you to lose twice as many soldiers.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="help_section">Performance</div>
            <p>Performance can be improved by closing panels and groups.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the summary panel minimize the armies, lords and vassals groups.  To do this click on the blue heading.</li>
                <li>Closing panels.</li>
                <li>Hiding the minimap and hex coordinates in the settings.</li>
                <li>Having less hexes on screen at once by making your browser window smaller or zooming in.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="help_section">UI Tips</div>
            <ul>
