            <p>When a unit is on the same hex as an enemy they will battle.  Every {{s_battle_interval}} all units in the battle will lose soldiers.  Winners lose {{s.battle_power_lost_per_round_winner}} power worth of soldiers and losers lose {{s.battle_power_lost_per_round}} power worth of soldiers.  Larger armies and more people in a battle cause losses to go up.</p>

            <div class="help_section">Attackers and Defenders</div>
            <p>If there is a castle or village in the battle then they are a defender.  If an army is on the same hex as their castle or village then they are a defender.  Otherwise the defender is the first army to arrive at the hex.  All allies of this defender are also defenders.</p>

            <div class="help_section">Power</div>
            <p>Every round if your unit's power + your ally's power is greater than your enemies' combined power then you are a winner that round.</p>

            <p>If you are a defender then your soldiers use their defend power.  If you're an attacker then they use their attack power.</p>
