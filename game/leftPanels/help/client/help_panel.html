						<p>You can send gold to your vassals.  You cannot send gold to your enemies or anyone above you in the tree.  To send someone gold click on the "Send Gold" button at their castle.</p>

						<p>When someone becomes the Dominus a {{date_duration_humanize s.time_til_game_end_when_new_dominus}} countdown starts.  If nobody else becomes the Dominus before the countdown ends then the last person who was the Dominus wins the game.  If someone new becomes the Dominus then the {{date_duration_humanize s.time_til_game_end_when_new_dominus}} countdown is restarted.</p>
						<p>The current countdown is in the alerts panel.</p>
						<p>The winner of the game gets the prize pool.  Check out the store panel for more info on the prize pool.</p>
						<p>While you are the Dominus your armies are able to attack anyone else's armies.</p>
						<p>After someone wins the game will end and a new one will start.  This may not happen exactly when the countdown ends.  It will happen as soon as Danimal has time.  An email will be sent to everyone letting them know that a new game has started.</p>

						<p>Email verification is required when someone creates an account with a password (not for Google or Facebook logins).  Players who haven't verified their email will not receive income.  The castle's info panel shows if a player hasn't yet verified their email.  This is visible to everyone.</p>
						<p>Gold transfers and buying soldiers for vassals are public.  Everyone can see alerts for these in the global alerts panel.</p>
						<p>If you suspect someone as having a duplicate account please report them.</p>
						<p>If someone is actively playing more than one account then both accounts will probably be deleted.</p>
						<p>If you wish to start another account please first delete your current account.</p>
