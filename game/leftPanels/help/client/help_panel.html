						<p>Every round if your unit's power + your ally's power is greater than your enemies' combined power then you are a winner that round.</p>

						<div class="help_section">Bonuses</div>
						<p>Bonuses can increase an army's power.</p>
						<p>Archers recieve a bonus against footmen. Pikemen recieve a bonus against cavalry. Calvary recieve a bonus against archers and footmen.</p>
						<p>When an archer fights a footman because the archer has a bonus against footmen the archer is twice as powerful.</p>
						<p>Catapults' offense is multiplied by {{s.army.stats.catapults.bonus_against_buildings}} when attacking a castle or village.  They must be on the same hex as an enemy castle or village.</p>

						<p>Armies defending a castle receive a {{castle_defense_bonus}}x bonus.  Armies defending a village receive a  {{village_defense_bonus}}x bonus.  Only armies inside the castle or village get this bonus.</p>

						<p>Armies on a vassal's castle or village receive a {{ally_castle_defense_bonus}}x bonus.  Armies on the same hex as their own castle or village but outside also receive this bonus.</p>

						<div class="help_section">Notifications</div>
						<p>After a battle you will receive a notification with the results.  You can also see battles as they happen in the notifications panel.</p>

						<div class="help_section">Who Gets the Spoils</div>
						<p>Multiple armies can attack a castle at the same time.  If they win the castle will go to the first army to arrive that is still alive.</p>

						<p>When someone becomes the Dominus a {{date_duration_humanize s.time_til_game_end_when_new_dominus}} countdown starts.  If nobody else becomes the Dominus before the countdown ends then the last person who was the Dominus wins the game.  If someone new becomes the Dominus then the {{date_duration_humanize s.time_til_game_end_when_new_dominus}} countdown is restarted.</p>
						<p>The current countdown is in the notifications panel.</p>
						<p>The winner of the game gets the prize pool.  Check out the store panel for more info on the prize pool.</p>
						<p>While you are the Dominus your armies are able to attack anyone else's armies.</p>
						<p>After someone wins the game will end and a new one will start.  This may not happen exactly when the countdown ends.  It will happen as soon as Danimal has time.  An email will be sent to everyone letting them know that a new game has started.</p>

						<p>Duplicate accounts are not allowed.</p>
						<p>Email verification is required when someone creates an account with a password (not for Google or Facebook logins).  Players who haven't verified their email will not receive income.  The castle's info panel shows if a player hasn't yet verified their email.  This is visible to everyone.</p>
						<p>Gold transfers and buying soldiers for vassals are public.  Everyone can see notifications for these in the global notifications panel.</p>
						<p>If you suspect someone as having a duplicate account please report them.</p>
						<p>If someone is actively playing more than one account then both accounts will probably be deleted.</p>
						<p>If you wish to start another account please first delete your current account.</p>

						<div class="help_section">Contributing</div>
						<p>
							You're already contributing by playing but here are a few other ways you can help.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Spread the Word</b><br>
							It's very hard to find new players without paying for ads.  There's a graph in the graph panel showing number of people playing.  Help make it grow. Please tweet, like, star, review Dominus and tell your friends.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Code</b><br>
							Check out Dominus on <a href="https://github.com/dan335/dominus">Github</a>.  Pull requests are appreciated.  Message Danimal for more info.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Money</b><br>
							Dominus' only income is through the store.  Help Dominus grow by buying cosmetic upgrades or donating money through the store panel.
						</p>

						<div class="help_section">Performance</div>
						<p>Performance can be improved by closing panels and groups.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In the summary panel minimize the armies, lords and vassals groups.  To do this click on the blue heading.</li>
							<li>Closing panels.</li>
							<li>Hiding the minimap and hex coordinates in the settings.</li>
							<li>Having less hexes on screen at once by making your browser window smaller or zooming in.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="help_section">UI Tips</div>
						<ul>
							<li>Ctrl + Shift + Mousewheel zooms in and out.</li>
							<li>Hover over chat messages to see the date and time.</li>
							<li>Change the size of the UI by using browser zoom.  Ctrl+mousewheel in chrome.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="help_section">Strategy</div>
						<ul>
							<li>Always combine your armies when in battle.  Each army in a battle takes losses.  Having two armies in a battle will cause you to lose twice as many soldiers.</li>
						</ul>
