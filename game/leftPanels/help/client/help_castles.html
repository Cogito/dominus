                <p>Your castle is the center of your kingdom.  It is where you hire soldiers.</p>
                <p>Castles are very defensive.  They have a {{castle_defense_bonus}}x defense bonus.</p>
                <p>If you attack someone's castle and win then you become their lord and they become your vassal.</p>
                <p>If an army of yours stops on the same hex as your castle then they will join your castle's garrison.</p>
