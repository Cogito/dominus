                <p>There are four different kinds of soldiers.  Some gain bonuses when fighting.</p>
                <p>Footmen recieve a bonus against pikemen. Archers recieve a bonus against footmen.  Pikemen recieve a bonus against cavalry.  Calvary recieve a bonus against archers and footmen.</p>
                <p>When an archer fights a footman because the archer has a bonus against footmen the archer is twice as powerful.</p>
                <p>Catapults have a different kind of bonus.  Catapults have a very low offense and defense.  When attacking a castle or village their offense is multiplied by their bonus.  If 1 catapult attacks an army it will have an offense of {{s.army.stats.catapults.offense}} but when that one catapult attacks a castle it will have an offense of {{s.army.stats.catapults.bonus_against_buildings}}.</p>

                <div class="help_section">Speed</div>
                <p>Armies move at the speed of their slowest unit.</p>

                <p>Footmen have a speed of {{s.army.stats.footmen.speed}}, archers have a speed of {{s.army.stats.archers.speed}}, pikemen have a speed of {{s.army.stats.pikemen.speed}} and cavalry have a speed of {{s.army.stats.cavalry.speed}}.</p>
                <p>An army of cavalry will travel {{s.army.stats.cavalry.speed}} hexes per hour but an army of cavalry and footmen will travel at {{s.army.stats.footmen.speed}} hexes per hour.</p>
